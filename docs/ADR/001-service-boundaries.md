# Architectural Decision Record: Service Boundaries

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Learning Atomizer platform uses a microservices architecture with well-defined service boundaries. This document formalizes these boundaries to ensure consistent evolution.

## Core Services Boundaries

### LoadBalancer Service
- **Primary Responsibility**: Request distribution and worker management
- **Dependencies**:
  - MemoryStore/Redis for state management
  - LoggerService for operational logging
- **Interface Contracts**:
  - Worker registration/deregistration
  - Health check endpoints
  - Metrics collection

### Cache Service
- **Primary Responsibility**: Data caching and retrieval
- **Dependencies**:
  - Redis for distributed caching
  - LoggerService for cache operations
- **Interface Contracts**:
  - Get/Set operations
  - Cache invalidation
  - Health monitoring

### Analytics Services
- **Primary Responsibility**: Data analysis and reporting
- **Dependencies**:
  - MLService for predictions
  - DataVisualizationService for rendering
- **Interface Contracts**:
  - Data ingestion APIs
  - Report generation
  - Real-time metrics

## Evolution Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. Maintain existing service boundaries
2. Follow established dependency patterns
3. Preserve current interface contracts

### Modifying Services
1. Ensure backward compatibility
2. Document all interface changes
3. Update relevant test cases

### Performance Optimization
1. Optimize within service boundaries
2. Maintain current monitoring patterns
3. Document performance impacts

## Consequences
- Clear service responsibilities
- Consistent interface design
- Maintainable codebase
- Scalable architecture
