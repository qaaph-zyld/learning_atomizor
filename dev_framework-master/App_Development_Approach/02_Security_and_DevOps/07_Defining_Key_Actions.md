# Key actions:

**Key Actions** refer to essential, specific actions or steps necessary to achieve a goal or perform a task effectively. Depending on context, they can mean:

- **In software/UI development:** Assigning keyboard shortcuts or macro commands to trigger functions quickly (e.g., mapping Ctrl+Alt+B to a "Back" display action)[^31_1][^31_8].
- **In project or program management:** Critical activities or interventions that drive desired outcomes, such as learning mobility in Erasmus+ programs, cooperation among organizations, or strategic operational steps[^31_2][^31_6].
- **In general usage:** The main actionable steps outlined to complete a project or objective successfully[^31_5].
