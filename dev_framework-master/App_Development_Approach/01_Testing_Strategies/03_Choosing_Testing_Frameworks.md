# What testing methods best align with growth-focused feature releases

For growth-focused feature releases, the best-aligned testing methods combine thorough automated testing with user-centric validation and rapid feedback loops. Key approaches include:

## 1. Automated Functional and Regression Testing

- Automate tests for core functionalities and previously tested features to ensure new releases don’t break existing behavior. This supports continuous integration and frequent releases without sacrificing stability[^17_1][^17_3][^17_5][^17_6].
- Regression testing is critical as features accumulate, preventing regressions that harm user experience[^17_6].


## 2. Feature Testing with Feature Flags

- Use feature toggles to roll out new features selectively to controlled user groups. This allows testing in production-like environments and quick rollback if issues arise[^17_5].
- Test different configurations and variations of features to optimize performance and usability before full launch[^17_5].


## 3. A/B Testing and Experimentation

- Perform A/B testing to compare feature variants or UI changes, gathering real user data on engagement and conversion[^17_2][^17_5].
- This data-driven approach reduces risk and guides feature refinement aligned with user preferences and business goals.


## 4. Exploratory Testing

- Complement automated tests with exploratory testing to uncover unexpected bugs and usability issues, especially for new or complex features[^17_7].
- It provides rapid feedback and deeper insights into user experience beyond scripted tests.


## 5. Performance and Load Testing

- As user base grows, include performance testing to ensure features scale and maintain responsiveness under load[^17_1][^17_6].
- Early performance validation avoids costly fixes post-launch.


## 6. Risk-Based and Prioritized Testing

- Prioritize testing efforts on high-impact, frequently used, or historically problematic features to optimize resource use and maximize quality impact[^17_4].
- Use code coverage and defect history to guide focus areas.
