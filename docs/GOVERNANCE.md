# Project Governance Framework

## Core Project Definition
- **Platform**: Learning Content Atomizer
- **Primary Objective**: Transform long-form content into digestible 2-3 minute learning modules
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Summarization Accuracy: 85%+
  - Processing Speed: <500ms per document
  - Memory Usage: <100MB RAM

## Technology Stack (Immutable)
- Frontend: Vue.js
- Backend: Node.js
- NLP: spaCy
- Database: MongoDB

## Development Gates

### GATE 0: Project Initialization (Current)
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Git repository initialization
- [x] CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Requirement documentation
- [ ] Architecture design document
- [ ] Risk assessment matrix

### GATE 1: Core Implementation
- [ ] Basic API endpoints
- [ ] Database schemas
- [ ] NLP pipeline setup
- [ ] Frontend scaffolding

### GATE 2: Feature Implementation

## Deviation Prevention Protocol
1. All changes must align with initial project scope
2. Feature requests require explicit approval
3. Performance metrics are non-negotiable
4. Technology stack changes require consensus

## Monitoring & Compliance
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular performance benchmarking
- Code quality metrics tracking
- Resource utilization monitoring

## Branch Protection Rules
- Main branch requires pull request
- CI checks must pass
- Code review required
- No direct commits to main
