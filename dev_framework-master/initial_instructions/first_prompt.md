You are tasked with creating a comprehensive app development knowledge base from a provided Markdown (MD) file containing a detailed multi-answer conversation.

### Your objectives:

1. **Create the folder structure** exactly as specified below:

/App_Development_Approach
│
├── 01_Testing_Strategies
│     └── 01_Avoiding_Testing_Bottlenecks.md
│     └── 02_Optimizing_Automated_Tests.md
│     └── 03_Parallel_Testing_Benefits.md
│     └── 04_Parallel_Testing_Techniques.md
│     └── 05_Test_Script_Maintenance.md
│     └── 06_Reliable_Feedback_Best_Practices.md
│     └── 07_Prioritizing_High_Impact_Tests.md
│     └── 08_Automating_Repetitive_Tests.md
│
├── 02_Security_and_DevOps
│     └── 09_Crucial_Security_Aspect.md
│     └── 10_Security_Integration_Advanced.md
│     └── 11_Security_Safety_Mindset_and_CI_CD.md
│     └── 12_Technical_Specifications_Details.md
│
├── 03_Development_Methodologies
│     └── 13_Low_Code_No_Code_Citizen_Dev.md
│     └── 14_Cross_Platform_Development.md
│     └── 15_AI_Driven_Design_Functionality.md
│     └── 16_Inclusive_Accessible_UX.md
│     └── 17_Super_Apps_Architecture.md
│     └── 18_Backend_API_Strategy.md
│     └── 19_Post_Launch_Support.md
│     └── 20_Mobile_App_Architecture.md
│     └── 21_Agile_Discovery_Process.md
│
├── 04_Project_Management_and_Planning
│     └── 22_Key_Actions_Overview.md
│     └── 23_Clarifying_Approach_Details.md
│     └── 24_Technical_Specifications_Which_To_Expand.md
│     └── 25_Folder_Structure_and_Summary.md
│
└── README.md   (this master file)

2. **Extract and populate each .md file** with the detailed content from the corresponding answer in the provided Markdown file.  
   - Use the answer numbers as references (e.g., Answer #1 content goes into 01_Avoiding_Testing_Bottlenecks.md).  
   - Ensure the content is cleanly formatted in Markdown, preserving headings, lists, tables, and code blocks.

3. **Create the README.md** file as the master navigation document referencing all other files, summarizing their content and guiding users on how to use the knowledge base.

4. **Maintain consistency** in formatting, naming conventions, and folder hierarchy.

5. **Prepare the project for easy future updates**, so new answers or best practices can be added by creating new files or updating existing ones.

### Additional instructions:

- If any content overlaps or needs splitting, organize logically but keep references clear.  
- Use clear, descriptive file names as per the list above.  
- Confirm that all referenced answers from the conversation are included.  
- Provide a summary at the top of each file indicating which answer it corresponds to.

---

### Input:

- The full Markdown file containing all answers from the conversation, numbered accordingly.

---

### Deliverables:

- A folder structure as specified.  
- Populated Markdown files with corresponding detailed content.  
- A README.md that acts as the master guide.

---

Please confirm understanding and proceed with implementation.
