### Ongoing Maintenance and Expansion Instructions

After creating the initial folder structure and populating each Markdown file with the detailed content from the provided conversation, please also implement the following best practices to support continuous updates and expansions:

1. **Living Documentation Approach**  
   - Treat all Markdown files as living documents that will be regularly reviewed and updated as new answers, best practices, or project insights emerge.  
   - Maintain version control (e.g., Git) for all files to track changes over time, enabling easy rollback and audit of updates.

2. **Clear Update Protocol**  
   - When new information or answers are added, create new Markdown files following the established naming and numbering conventions (e.g., 26_New_Topic.md).  
   - For updates to existing topics, append new content under a clearly marked “Update” or “Revision” section with date stamps for traceability.  
   - Avoid overwriting original content without preserving history.

3. **Consistent Formatting and Cross-Referencing**  
   - Ensure all new or updated files maintain consistent Markdown formatting, including headings, lists, tables, and code blocks.  
   - Update the master README.md file to include references to new files or updated sections, keeping navigation current.

4. **Collaboration and Accessibility**  
   - Store the entire folder structure in a shared, accessible repository or document management system to facilitate team collaboration and feedback.  
   - Use tools that support commenting and versioning to encourage continuous improvement and discussion.

5. **Scheduled Reviews**  
   - Recommend scheduling regular review cycles (e.g., quarterly) to audit the knowledge base, remove obsolete information, and incorporate lessons learned or emerging trends.  
   - During reviews, update the Definition of Done (DoD) and acceptance criteria documentation to reflect evolving quality standards.

6. **Traceability and Change Logs**  
   - Maintain a CHANGELOG.md file at the root level documenting all significant additions, updates, and removals with dates and brief descriptions.  
   - Link change logs from individual files when relevant to provide context.

7. **Scalability and Modular Growth**  
   - Design the folder and file structure to be modular and scalable, allowing easy addition of new categories or topics without disrupting existing organization.

### Summary

By following these guidelines, the knowledge base will remain accurate, relevant, and valuable throughout the project lifecycle, supporting continuous learning and adaptation.

### Deliverables for Maintenance Phase

- New or updated Markdown files with clear versioning and update sections.  
- An updated README.md reflecting all changes.  
- A CHANGELOG.md documenting modifications.  
- Consistent formatting and cross-references throughout.
