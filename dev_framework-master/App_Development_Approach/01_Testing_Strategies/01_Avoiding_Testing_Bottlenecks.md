# When is the optimal time to shift from feature development to testing in my roadmap

The optimal time to shift from feature development to testing is **as early as possible**, ideally integrating testing activities throughout the development process rather than waiting until feature development is complete. This approach is known as **Shift-Left Testing** and is strongly recommended in modern DevOps practices[^15_1].

### Key Points for Timing the Shift:

- **Begin testing alongside development:** Write automated tests (unit, integration) while coding features to catch bugs early and reduce costly fixes later.
- **Avoid waiting until 50% or more of development is done:** Traditional models delay testing until late stages, which increases risk and rework. Shift-Left testing moves testing to the "left" side of the timeline, meaning earlier in the SDLC[^15_1].
- **Incorporate continuous integration (CI):** Run tests automatically on every code commit or merge to get immediate feedback and maintain quality.
- **Use feature toggles or branches:** This allows incomplete features to be tested incrementally without blocking overall progress.
- **Balance with exploratory and user acceptance testing:** While automated tests run early, some manual or system-level testing can occur later in beta or staging phases to validate real-world usage[^15_3][^15_5].


### Practical Roadmap Guidance:

| Phase | Testing Focus | When to Shift Testing |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Initial Development (MVP) | Unit and integration tests on core features | From day one, alongside coding |
| Beta \& Feedback | User acceptance, exploratory testing | After initial feature completion, ongoing |
| Iteration \& Product-Market Fit | Regression, performance, security tests | Continuous, with each iteration |
| Scaling \& Production | Load, failover, security, monitoring | Pre-release and post-deployment (Shift-Right) |

### Benefits of Early Shift to Testing (Shift-Left)[^15_1]:

- Faster feedback and bug detection
- Reduced cost and effort for fixes
- Improved software quality and stability
- Accelerated time to market

---

**Summary:**
Start testing **immediately as features are developed**, integrating automated tests into your CI pipeline. Avoid postponing testing until late phases. This shift-left approach ensures issues are caught early, enabling smoother, faster, and more reliable delivery.
